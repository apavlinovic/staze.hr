### Spinning up the database

Run the following command to start the database container

> docker run --name "staze-hr-db" -p 25432:5432 -d -t zeroghan/staze-hr-db

This will download the database image and setup a postgres contianer running on localhost:25432. The username and password for this postgres instance are "docker".

You can use pgAdmin to explore it, but you don't have to if you don't care about it. https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-windows/

## Branch permissions and naming strategy

-   **master is not protected against pushes**. This is a limitation for Github's private repositories and only available for public and PRO repos. Please do not push into master if you're working on a feature. Bug fixes should be pushed directly to master.
-   **Branch naming strategy**:

> staze-descriptive-branch-name

-   **Commmit messages guide** is available here https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/
